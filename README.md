Project Description
---------------------
This is a project that I created for my post AP Data Structures and Algorithms class as a senior in high school. We learned about graphs and the minimax algorithm before creating a board game super class and then a subclass to use it on. I created a checkers game to test this on, but unfortunately I did not save the code from it anywhere before my old computer broke. After this checkers game I created the fifteen game that is in the repository. It uses reinforcement learning and some created training data to solve the game. Unfortunately I only saved the code off my old computer and need to remake the training data text files that the program uses before it can run properly.
